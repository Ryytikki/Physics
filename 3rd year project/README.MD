Core file/images for my 3rd year project - Eventual fate of planetary systems
Built with Ross Barton under Graham Wynn at the university of leicester in winter 2013.

Models the change in apoapsis of a planetary system due to mass loss of the star as it moves down the AGB stage of its life cycle. Originally designed to search for any resonances that may be created and planetary ejections that would occur but none could be found in the timeframe that the simulation was ran.
