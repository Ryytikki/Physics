This is a collection of the files I created during my internship at the British Space Science Centre in leicester. I was primarily working on topological data of the earth collected from the SRTM sattelite although I was using a modified version that can be found here: http://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/dem3.html

high resolution images of the final map i created can be found here: http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2013/215/7/b/fsrtm30_data_map_by_ryytikki-d6ggfm2.png
